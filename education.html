<big><b>Schools that I've been to:</b></big>
<p>During my teenage years my family moved around a lot, from one state to another, ergo I've studied in several schools.
Three primary schools and two secondary schools to be exact. It was exhausting, and we had our ups and downs, that's how 
life teaches you about the world.</p>

<dt>Hence, I pursue my secondary studies at the High School of Port Dickson, where I engaged in so many amazing extra curriculums!.
From cheerleading, to dance classes and even became a Junior Caunselor.

<dt>Eventually, after 6 months in SMKTPD, we had to move again, except we're moving back to our old house in Seremban.
There I pursued the engineering course for two years, and became the school's reporter.
